Welcome to my portfolio and project log! This site showcases my professional journey, highlighting key projects, personal achievements, and growth over time. Here, youâ€™ll find detailed write-ups of the work Iâ€™ve done, from initial concept to final execution, alongside insights into the challenges faced and lessons learned.

## Why This Exists
I have a lot of random projects and interests. Hopefully this will let me organize what I do just a bit better. ðŸš€

## Framework
This project uses [`svelte 5`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/overview) and [`sveltekit`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction). It is pre-rendered and served from [`Cloudflare Pages`](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Build and Deployment
This portfolio is built with `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` and deployed to [`Cloudflare Pages`](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). All routes are pre-rendered and statically served from `Cloudflare`.

Deployments are automatically executed when pushing and during pull requests. Unit tests and E2E testing are also done automatically.

## Folder Structure
All source code is in `src`, with `lib` and `routes` being the primary development folders.
